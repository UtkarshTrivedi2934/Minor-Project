# Project Title: Distracted Driver Detection

- Aim:
The aim of this project is to develop a system that can detect distracted driving behavior using machine learning techniques. By analyzing images or video frames from a vehicle's camera, the system can classify whether a driver is engaged in activities that could lead to distraction, such as texting, talking on the phone, eating, or not paying attention to the road.

## Data Collection and Preprocessing:
- Dataset: Acquire a dataset of images or video frames labeled with different driving activities.
- Preprocessing: Normalize and resize images, augment the data to increase diversity, and split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.

## Model Development:
- Model Selection: Choose a suitable machine learning model or neural network architecture for image classification, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
- Training: Train the model on the preprocessed dataset, fine-tune hyperparameters, and implement techniques to prevent overfitting, such as dropout or regularization.

## Evaluation:
- Metrics: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
- Validation: Validate the model using a separate validation set and test its generalization ability on a test set.

## Deployment:
- Implementation: Develop a real-time detection system that can process live video feeds and classify driving behavior.
- Interface: Create a user interface to display the detection results, alert the driver, and provide actionable feedback.

## Documentation and Reporting:
- Documentation: Document the entire process, including data collection, preprocessing, model development, and evaluation.
- Reporting: Compile the results into a comprehensive report, highlighting key findings, challenges, and potential improvements.
